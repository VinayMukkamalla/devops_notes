SED editor
===========
strealine editor, non-interactive editor

create the line
update the line
delete the line

sed '1i Hello SED' <file-name> -> insert before first line
sed '1a Hello' -> insert after first line
sed '2d' -> delete 2nd line
sed '/Hello/d' -> delete lines where there is Hello
sed 's/root/ROOT/' -> substitute the first occurence in every line
sed 's/root/ROOT/g' -> substitute all occurences in every line
sed '3c Hello change' -> replace 3rd line
sed '/error/ c NO-ERROR' -> change the line based on pattern

idempotent
============
Scripts should give same results even you run them infinte times -> this is called idempotency

GET -> idempotent
POST -> chance of duplicates or error... we need work for idempotency
PUT/UPDATE -> not danger, check if already same then don't allow to change
DELETE -> not danger, but check if already deleted, then tell it is deleted already

check roboshop user already exist or not, if exist skip otherwise create

mongodb is a non relational database so it uses keyvalue pairs instead of tables it uses collections


mongosh mongodb.daws86s.fun --quiet --eval "db.getMongo().getDBNames().indexOf('catalogue')"  --> it will check the index of database catalogue if it is present it will return index of catalogue database like 1 or 2 

if it is not present then it will give index as a negative value (-1 or <0)


set -euo pipefail  -> 21 set.sh -->( it means an instructionto exit and fail execution whenever error occurs)

set -e(-e --> exit) --> stops execution and exits from the script

-----------------------

set -e


trap 'echo "there is an error $LINENO, command is : $BASH_COMMAND"' ERR 
----------------------------------------------
set -e

# error(){
#     #error function
#    # echo "there is an error $LINENO, command is : $BASH_COMMAND"
# }

# trap will execuete when there is an error trap is a command shell will call trap by default ehen there is an ERR

trap 'echo "there is an error $LINENO, command is : $BASH_COMMAND"' ERR
