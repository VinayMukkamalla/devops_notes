sudo su -

user and group creation

useradd suresh  --> when you create a user in Linux bydefault a group will be created with the username
groupadd devops

cat /etc/passwd
suresh:x:1001:1001::/home/suresh:/bin/bash

cat /etc/group  --> A user in Linux must have atleast 1 primary group and 1 secondary group
suresh:x:1001:
devops:x:1002:


password(encrypted)

cat /etc/shadow

ec2-user:!!:20342:0:99999:7:::
suresh:!!:20342:0:99999:7:::


usermod -g <groupname> <username>

id suresh
 gid=1001(suresh) groups=1001(suresh)
usermod -g devops suresh
id suresh
gid=1002(devops) groups=1002(devops)

secondary group is used to give access to other teams temporarily

allow users to login using password 

vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config  --> :/PasswordAuthentication  no --> yes

sshd -t to check after changing as the above file is very important

 systemctl restart sshd   -->  restart to reflect changes

as we have given access to suresh to login to server through username and password he can login

by using ssh suresh@ipaddress

last -->  to check whoever logged in

remove user from group --> gpasswd -d suresh operations

gpasswd -d suresh operations


       useradd suresh
   10  groupadd devops
   11  id suresh
   12  cat /etc/passwd/
   13  cat /etc/passwd
   14  cat /etc/group
   15  cat /etc/shadow
   16  clear
   17  id suresh
   18  usermod -g devops suresh
   19  id suresh
   20  history
   21  pwd
   22  sudo su -
   23  who
   24  groupadd operations
   25  cat /etc/group
   26  usemod -aG operations suresh
   27  usermod -aG operations suresh
   28  id suresh
   29  passwd suresh
   30  vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   31  sshd -t
   32  history
   33  systemctl restart sshd
   34  exit
