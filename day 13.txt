RabbitMQ
==============

asynchronous vs synchronous:
===============================

MQ --> message Queue

synchronous : expects response immediately and shows error if response not received(laptop expecting a response for an http request)

Asynchronous : fire and forget will send a message and forget (sending whatsapp message to a person who is currently offline it will reach him when he is available until it stores the message somewhere like rabbitmq)


producer(sender) --> consumer(receiver)

producer --> mq database(broker) --> consumer 

if consumer is online it will listen to MQ database and it will receive the information(message)

if the consumer in not online then the message waits in the storage (mQ databse)

MQ use cases:
=============

Decoupling of systems

tight coupling : if one system is down other systems dependant on the the system will also be down

loose coupling: system A sends a message to system B when it is down then the message is stored somewhere and it is sent to system B when it is online


Relibility:
==============

messages are stored until they are delivered

Scalability:
=============
we can send many requests at a time and messages are delivered in a queue


bank transfers within india ---> displays result immediately whether transaction failed or successfull  --> sysnchronous


point to point --> queue  --> {producer to one consumer}  [sending a message to queue]

publish and subscribe --> topic{ producer to many consumers}  [sending a message to a topic and all the people who are subscribed will receive the message]

upto @36 mins theory but important so cover once finished practicing 


ActiveMQ

RabbitMQ

IBMMQ

kafkaMQ  -> handles huge data like Netflix etc

=============================================================================================

Payment
==========
python files -> .py
build tool -> pip
build file -> requirements.txt(dependency information)

10th class results link --> AP/TG gov

AP/TG API Link

hall ticket --> respond with results

Manual Process
=================
1. too much time
2. repeated same process
3. too many errors
4. tough to troubleshoot
5. continous network connection

create server
configuring the server
	install programming language
	create system user
	create directory
		download the code
		unzip the code
		install dependency
	create systemctl service
		daemon-reload
		restart the service
	
deployment
===========
1. remove old code
2. download new code
3. restart the service
