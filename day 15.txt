everything is a process in linux that runs in an enironment process will be alive until it is ended

ec2-user is a process and if we run shell script using ec2-user

shell script is a subprocess of ec2-user process

declare a environment variable:

export CAPITAL=hyderabad

here CAPITAL is an environment variable

you can access environment variables in script also 

#go to home file of the user and look for hidden files ls -la

.bashrc

vim .bashrc  edit and add system variable at last before line

source .bashrc

then everytime a new process starts the environmant variable wll get auto assigned 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

run commands dynamically inside a shell script and get output

like:

script ececution start time

script ececution end time

how much time does the script run {end time - start time }

command :

date --> to get date with timestamp

date +%F  --> to get formatted date

date +%Y 

date +%Y-%m 

date +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S { here -(hyphen) is differentiator optional for formatting}

to get complete date and time in only seconds use

date +%s(small s)


any progamming language:
-----------------------------
boolean (true or false)
operators(arithmetic, logical, bitwise,)

variables
data types
conditions
functions
loops
error handling

there are no explicit data types in shell script. everything in shell is considered as string..
