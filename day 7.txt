AMI --> amazon machine image --> devops practice (our custom AMI)

What is AMI?
=============
Image --> image is everything around us in a picture along with us
Amazon image --> Image is OS + some required software

Image is providing a hardware pre installed Softwares OS and some pre installed applications like MacFee, msword, msppt, etc 


Linux 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Linux is OS or Kernel?
=======================
Linus Torwalds -> Linux and Git

Mac -> Hardware + MacOS
Dell -> Hardware + OS(Optional) -> we have freedom to install any OS

dominating OS for servers was Unix
Unix -> Hardware+UnixOS

He completely developed a Kernel from the scratch using C language. 

Kernel = a component that connects with Hardware
OS = Kernel + some utilities or applications for user

Centos, Fedora, Ubuntu, Android, Oracle Suse, Redhat

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Redhat Family
==============
Opensource vs Enterprise

Opensource -> free and community driven. we need to wait for fix
Enterprise -> We pay money for support. if there are defects immidiately we get help

Enterprise = Opensource + Support

Redhat = Kernel + Application Utilities + Support

Amazon Linux == Redhat == Centos == Fedora == Almalinux consider all same

devops-practice = RHEL based
devops AMI use below credentials
username=ec2-user 
Password=DevOps321
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
different flavous

opensource VS enterprise

Red hat enterprise 

redhat ==> Linux kernel +app utilities + support

Amazon-Linux --> Redhat Linux

=====================================================================================================================================================
devops-practice = RHEL based
devops AMI use below credentials
username=ec2-user 
Password=DevOps321

this devops-practice AMI is developed by joindevops shiva 
this AMI if we use while launching instance 
it will allow user to connect without keys 

ssh ec2-user@ipbaddress

password : DevOps321

it will show public ip | private ip| instance type(t3.micro)
some added colors  --> enabled some colors and packages

it by default takes 20gb hard disk (this is concerning as it may consume more resources and can be charged more)

user --> captain --> waiter --> chef --> raw-materials

user --> load balancer --> web --> application --> Database


Database: @ 40 mins

Database = BOX == server == Node 
Database server is a physical server

we install a server and we install database related application(software) on the server

two types of database servers

relational and Non relational Databases

RDBMS --> Relational database management system: to store and manage data in a rows and columns tabular format(tables)
EXCEL --> to store data and organize data --> rows and columns (sheets)


RDBMS softwares like : MySQL, oraclesql

we use MySQL-server

so in the instance we launched we change it's name to database and also install mysql-server on it

sudo su -

how to install app?
--------------------
use:
dnf install mysql-server -y

after installing we should start the server
how to start the server?
-------------------------
use:

systemctl start mysqld   -->(d refers to deamon it will run continuously without needing a restart for years @47mins)

How to check the status of application?
-------------------------------------
use:

systemctl status mysqld

--> active and runing

we can enable the MySQL server to make it automatically run after a restart

how to enable the mysql-server to run automatically after restart?
------------------------------------------------------------------

dnf enable mysqld


how to confirm if it is running?
---------------------------------------
use:

ps -ef| grep mysqld  --> it will list the processes

how to check if ports are opened for mysqld?
-------------------------------------------- @49mins
use:

netstat -lntp    --> it will list tcp protocols and you can find port number and service name if ports are opened for the service

MySQL port number --> 3306

default admin user for MySQL server is "root"

we have to set a root password for the user 

how do we set password for root user in MySQL server?

use:

mysql_secure_installation --set-root-pass ExpenseApp@1(password)

now installation of MySQL -server and default user is root and we have set root password to ExpenseApp@1

now we have to connect to the mysqlserver

how to connect to MySQL server?
=============================


To connect to any other system 

we need the below:

IP, port, protocol,&& username & password || key


for example:

if we want to connect to facebook serve

we should use the below

to connect remotely:
---------------------

https --> protocol

ipaddress:/facebook.com(here we pass this /facebook.com and dns will convert to ip address)

username and password:

port: 443(it will take automatically)


we are in windows ad we have connected remotely to a database server(using remote login) in which we installed database server 

AS we installed MySQL server within in server we don't need ip address to connect to the MySQL if we are logged in to the server already

how to connect to MySQL server remotely?:
--------------------------------------------

to connect remotely -->

 use:  mysql -h <host-address> -u root -p<password>

how to connect to MySQL server locally?:
---------------------------------------

to connect locally if we are in the server where MySQL is installed and running -->

 use:  mysql -u root -p<password>

no space between -p and password (ex: -pExpenseApp@1)

so mysql -u root -pExpesnseApp@1 or use : mysql

diagram @ 55mins

Database Linux Server -> Database Server Installation -> Schema/databases -> tables -> Data

@1hr

as we have now connected to mysql db we have to use mysql language to communicate

show databases; --> will show databases available


use dbname; -->   cursor moves to dbname


show tables; -->  cursor moves to table

you can now use mysql queries communicate with mysql db and fetches data in the form of records rows and cols joins etc..


APPLICATION SERVER (application  server):
===================================

database server setup installation is ready now we launch another server and deploy our application in the server  


backend/app tier:

which language and which version to use for app development is developer decison (Java 1.8, pthon 3.2.4, node js)

launch an instance 

@1hr 9mins Mobaxterm(tabbed SSH client)
click on session 

click on ssh

give ip address + ok

give username and password and login to server

dnf module disable nodejs -y --> disabling default nodejs version 

dnf module enable nodejs:20 -y --> enable especially node js 20 (version 20)

now if we install nodejs it will auto install version 20

dnf install nodejs -y

//we installed nodejs to run nodejs code as the application is developed using nodejs language and nodejs -> is Runtime, like jre for java



Add Application user:
====================================

ps -ef| grep mysql

who is running mysql? --> mysql
 
is mysql a human user or non human user? -->  non human user or system user  | system account/ service account

to avoid dependency on humans and to secure access  --> to avoid security vulnerabilities by loosing login credentials.


system account/ service account  -> non human users --> will not have passwords --> used to run applications


so we use system user called Expense to access our application with non human user

useradd Expense   --> creates our system user i.e Expense --> sys user name


create folder for application:
=============================

mkdir /app    --> to store application code by downloading


curl-o /tmp/backend.zip https://expense-builds.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/expense-backend-v2.zip

we are downloading by using curl -o path-to-store  URL

we are temporarily storing data in /tmp folder in a new file called backend.zip file

we can use wget to download but we have to be in the path it downloads in current path(my assumption)//  whereas curl URL displays the content in a file 

/tmp --> temporary we will download into temp folder and then modify the data and then move to or required destination path


cd /app  --> now moving to /app folder to store our application code which we downloaded in /tmp/backend.zip from internet(s3)using URL -> https://expense-builds.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/expense-backend-v2.zip

unzip /tmp/backend.zip 

developer responsibilities VS Devops responsibilities:
=======================================================

deciding coding language and version of language is architectural decision and developers will give us the version

we have install runtime ,

download application and dependencies to /tmp ,

then we have to create /app ->(a location to store application code)

and unzip dependencies(ZIP file) in the /app dir to store the code
